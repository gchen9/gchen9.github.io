    <p id="first-paragraph"> I am a Freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University at
    Buffalo. I decided to major in computer science because I thought it would
    be fun, however I might find an interest for another major in the future.
    Before graduating High School, I was a devoted member of Key Club, a community
    service organization. Waking up early in the morning became natural since events
    were one to two hour commute away. Now that I'm in college, I don't exactly have
    a goal for myself. I don't know what my plans are for the future or what my "dream job" will be,
    but I hope it'll be doing something I'll love very much. Confucius said,
    "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."
